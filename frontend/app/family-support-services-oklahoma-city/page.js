    <p>Sometimes families know they need help but don&apos;t know what kind of help they need.</p>

      <li><span className="fs-quote-icon">?</span>&ldquo;Where can we find support?&rdquo;</li>

    <p>Those questions can feel even harder when you&apos;re already worried about your child, your relationships, or your family&apos;s future.</p>
    <p>Open Arms Initiative exists to help families feel less alone while navigating those questions.</p>

    <h2>Sometimes Counseling Is Part of the Support</h2>
    <p>Some families may benefit from therapeutic services in addition to broader family support.</p>
    <p>If communication has become difficult, relationships feel strained, or your household is navigating significant emotional challenges, our <Link href="/family-therapy-oklahoma-city/">Family Counseling</Link> services may provide a more appropriate therapeutic environment.</p>
    <p>If your child or teenager is experiencing emotional or behavioral concerns, you can also explore our <Link href="/child-counseling-services-oklahoma-city/">Child &amp; Adolescent Counseling</Link> services.</p>
    <p><strong>Our goal is to help you understand the available options, not make you figure out the entire path by yourself.</strong></p>
